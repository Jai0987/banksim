#       # container images from a container repository like docker hub.  Since we are just demoing
#       # we manually installed the container inside of kind via the command in the instructions
#       # 'kind load docker-image ...' thus this tells the API to check if the container is present
#       # and if so use it, if not, find it in the repository.  Also notice i did not tag the image
#       # by default it will put ':latest' at the end, best practice is to fix to a tagged image so
